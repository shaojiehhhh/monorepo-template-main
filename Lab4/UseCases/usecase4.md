**Use Case**: Adjusting Canvas Size

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: User wants to change the size of the canvas for drawing.

**Preconditions**: The drawing application is open. The user is in the drawing mode.

**Trigger**: The user performs an action to adjust the canvas size.
  
**Scenario**: 
User launches the drawing application.
The application opens a window with a default canvas size (e.g., 600x400 pixels).
User decides to adjust the canvas size and accesses a menu or dialog for canvas settings.
User specifies the desired width and height for the canvas.
The application updates the canvas size accordingly.
 
**Exceptions**: 
If the user specifies invalid dimensions (e.g., negative values or non-numeric input), the application displays an error message and does not change the canvas size.
If there are unsaved drawings on the canvas, the application may prompt the user to save or discard them before resizing.

**Priority**: Medium

**When available**: Next software release

**Channel to actor**: Graphic User Interface

**Secondary Actor**: N/A
**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: Consider providing predefined canvas size options for user convenience, such as "Letter," "A4," or "Custom."
