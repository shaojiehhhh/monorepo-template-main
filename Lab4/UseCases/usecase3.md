<hr>

**Use Case**: Undoing Last Drawing Action

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: User wants to undo the last drawing action on the canvas.

**Preconditions**: The drawing application is open and the canvas is displayed. The user has performed at least one drawing action.

**Trigger**: The user presses a specified key combination (e.g., Ctrl + Z) to undo the last drawing action.
  
**Scenario**: 
User launches the drawing application.
The application opens a window with a 600x400-pixel canvas.
User selects a drawing color using the number keys (1-8).
User draws on the canvas.
Realizing a mistake, the user presses the specified key combination (e.g., Ctrl + Z) to undo the last drawing action.
The last drawing action is reversed, and the canvas reverts to its previous state.
 
**Exceptions**: If the user attempts to undo when there are no previous drawing actions to undo, the application provides feedback that there is nothing to undo.
If there are multiple levels of undo available, the user can continue pressing the undo key combination to step back through multiple drawing actions.

**Priority**: Medium

**When available**: Next software release

**Channel to actor**: Graphic User Interface

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A
**Open Issues**: Consider implementing a redo functionality to allow the user to reverse an undo action if needed.
