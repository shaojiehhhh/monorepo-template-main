**Use Case**: Selecting Drawing Color

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: User wants to select a color for drawing on the canvas.

**Preconditions**: The drawing application is open and the canvas is displayed. The user is in the drawing mode.

**Trigger**: The user presses one of the number keys (1-8) to select a drawing color.
  
**Scenario**: 
User launches the drawing application.
The application opens a window with a 600x400-pixel canvas.
User presses one of the number keys (1-8) to choose a drawing color:
1 = Black
2 = White
3 = Red
4 = Green
5 = Blue
6 = Yellow
7 = Magenta
8 = Cyan
The selected color is visually indicated to the user, such as highlighting the selected color or displaying the color code.
 
**Exceptions**: If the user presses a key that is not in the range of 1-8, the application provides feedback and does not change the drawing color. If the application encounters an error in changing the color, it displays an error message to the user.
